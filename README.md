This is my first project that consists of landing page of BestShop - a 
platform that lets you open an online store. 
First it was just a simple layout, after time I learned 
responsive web design and updated the project - changed units 
to relative and used media queries according to mobile first rule. 
Also used JS to make an event of changing display of menu on click.

##### Technologies used in the project
