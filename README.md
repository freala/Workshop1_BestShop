This is my first project that consists of landing page of BestShop - a platform that lets you open an online store. First it was just a simple layout, after time I learned responsive web design and updated the project - changed units to relative and used media queries according to mobile first rule.

##### Technologies used in the project

  - *HTML5*
  - *CSS3*
